# Javascript-Goodies
A variety of javascript related scripts that help with day to day tasks

## Collaborator
There are two scripts here that assist in navigating [SmartBear's Collaborator](https://smartbear.com/product/collaborator/overview/) reviews. These two scripts are javascript injections meant to be bookmarked or wrapped in some Javascript extension like [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for ease of use.
* collab-next-unread.js - Jumps the page to the next unread item in a Collaborator review
* collab-click-unread.js - Opens the file that contains the next unread item in a Collaborator review

Instructions of how to use them are dictated in the files themselves.
